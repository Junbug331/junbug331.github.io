# Last point of rectangle 
## Given 3 coordinate points(x, y) find a remaining last point of the rectangle.

* Difficulty: Easy
* Keypoints: **map**, **reduce**, **XOR**


It is not a hard problem but there is a simple pythonic way of solving this problem.  


Inputs : v = [[1,4], [3,4], [3, 10]] 
```python
from functools import reduce

def solution(v):
    tp = list(zip(*v))
    return list(map(lambda pt: reduct(lambda x, y: x ^ y), tp))
```
  
### Code Breakdown
`1`. group x points and y points.
```python
    tp = list(zip(*v))
```
`v` = [[1, 4], [3, 4], [3, 10]]   
`*v` = [1, 4], [3, 4], [3,10]   
`zip(*v)` = [1, 3, 3], [4, 4, 10]  
* Here, [1, 3, 3] is a list of x points and [4,4, 10] is a list of y points.    

`list(zip(*v))` = [[1, 3, 3], [4, 4, 10]]

```python
    return list(map(lambda pt: reduct(lambda x, y: x ^ y, pt), tp))
```
`2`. map, reduce, XOR
* map is applied to [ [x points], [y points] ]
* reduce is applied to [points]
* ex)   
``` python
reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, [1, 3, 3])
> (1 ^ 3) ^ 3 = 1
reduce(lambda x, y: x ^ y, [4, 4, 10])
> (4 ^ 4) ^ 10 = 10
```
Hence, answer is [1, 10]
